# we have used the percent (%) character to denote that part of the target and dependency that matches whatever the pattern is used for, 
# and the $< is a special variable (imaging it like $(<)) that means "whatever the depencies are". 
# Another useful variable is $@, which means "the target".

## TARGET : DEPENDENCY
